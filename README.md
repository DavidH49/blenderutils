# DDDs Blenderutils

Very simple utility addon.  
I made this addon for my specific personal workflow, so I can quickly add things like a cube with its origin on its bottom face, which I have to do very often.

## Version 2.0.0 contains:
#### Operators | Side Panel -> DDD
* Quick Bevel
* Quick Mirror
* Array 1D
* Array 2D
* Array 3D

#### Objects | Add Object -> Mesh
* Bottom Cube
* Corner Cube

## Building
To build the extension, run *build.sh* or *build.bat*, depending on your OS.  
If buildung fails, check if your blender executable is in your system's PATH.
