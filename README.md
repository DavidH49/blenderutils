# DDDs Blenderutils

Very simple utility addon.  
I made this addon for my personal workflow, so I can quickly add things I have to use all the time, such as bevel modifiers.


## Version 2.2.0 contains:
#### Operators | Side Panel > Item > DDD - Util
* Reset Transform
* Bevel
* Mirror
* Array 1D
* Array 2D
* Array 3D

#### Objects | Add > Mesh
* Bottom Cube
* Edge Cube
* Corner Cube


## Building
To build the extension, run *build.sh* or *build.bat*, depending on your OS.  
If buildung fails, check if your blender executable is in your system's PATH.
